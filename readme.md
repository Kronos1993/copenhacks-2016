# Copenhacks 2016: Messenger Privacy Guard
* This is the project that team Floki did during Copenhacks 2016.
* Convenient messaging with privacy. 
* We encrypt conversations with your friends through Facebook Messenger.

### 1. Create your GPG keys
GNU Privacy Guard is an open source implementation of the OpenPGP standard. Use it to create and manage your keys to encrypt Messenger chats. [Go to Github's GPG instructions](https://help.github.com/categories/gpg)

### 2. Provide your public GPG key to Facebook
Put your public PGP key on your Facebook account	for easier integration with MGP.Go to your Facebook profile page and then in the "About" tab. Under the "Contact and basic info" you will find the field for the public key. [Go to Facebook profile](http://facebook.com/profile.php/about?section=contact-info&pnref=about" class="special)

### 3. Install Messenger Privacy Guard plugin
Encrypt communication between you and your friends over Messanger! Rest assured no one can read your conversations!
