Node-GPG takes care of spawning `gpg`, passing it\nthe correct arguments, and piping input to stdin. It can also pipe input in from files and output out to files.\n\nUse Node-GPG if you are considering calling `gpg` directly from your application.\n\n## Requirements\n\nIn order to use Node-GPG, you'll need to have the `gpg` binary in your $PATH.\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install gpg\n\n## Usage\n\nNode-GPG supports both direct calls to GPG with string arguments, and streaming calls for piping input and output\nfrom/to files.\n\nSee [the source](lib/gpg.js) for more details.\n\nIf a function you need is not implemented, you can call gpg directly with arguments of your choice by\ncalling `gpg.call(stdinStr, argsArray, cb)`, or `gpg.callStreaming(inputFileName, outputFileName, argsArray, cb)`.\n\n## Notes\n\nExisting implementations of PGP in Javascript are blocking and unfeasibly slow for server use.\nIn casual testing, encrypting a simple 400-character email to an El-Gamal key took upwards of 11 seconds using\n[openpgpjs](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs) and 14 seconds with [kbpgp](https://github.com/keybase/kbpgp),\nbut takes less than 0.1 seconds with `gpg` directly.\n\n## Contributors\n\nThe following are the major contributors of `node-gpg` (in no specific order).\n\n  * Nicholas Penree ([drudge](http://github.com/drudge))\n  * [freewil](http://github.com/freewil)\n  * Samuel Reed [strml](http://github.com/strml)\n",
